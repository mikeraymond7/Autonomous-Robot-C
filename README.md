# Autonomous-Robot-C
## Purpose
- This project was a final project for an upper level class. The purpose was to convert code for Adafruit I2C and PWM connections into C language code that completes the same operations. 
- Additionally, an ultrasonic sensor was added to the robot and the corresponding code that operates it.
  - Upon a reading of less than a designated distance, the robot stops, turns, and continues running
